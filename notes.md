### DATA USED 

|name|Specific gravity|
|----|-----|
|Oil, olive (at 15.6 C)|0.91-0.92†|
|Oil, rapeseed (at 20 C) [i.e. Canola oil]|0.92|


<sup>[†]</sup> For this i'm just gonna average out the values. So $\frac{0.91 + 0.92}{2} = 0.915$ Then multiply by $1 \frac{g}{cm³}$ to cancel out the water part (denominator) (googled specific gravity and it said it's a ratio of density over density of water which is 1.0 I think so it makes no sense what the utility is...)

I think Canola oil (i.e. rapeseed) should be preferred, presumably it’s “more pure” or whatnot, since olive oil is processed from the olive food thing, and generally natural products which will be composed of a more diverse array of chemicals, so maybe the math will be more robust with Canola oil?

This literally gives you everything you need to know for both **sodium hydroxide** and/or **Potassium hydroxide**, although their method isn't cold pressed,
